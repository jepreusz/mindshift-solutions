Vulnerability Descriptionmod_proxy in httpd in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.9, when running on Unix, does not close the backend connection if a timeout occurs when reading a response from a persistent connection, which allows remote attackers to obtain a potentially sensitive response intended for a different client in opportunistic circumstances via a normal HTTP request. NOTE: this is the same issue as CVE-2010-2068, but for a different OS and set of affected versions. (CVE-2010-2791)ImpactThis vulnerability can allow the unauthorized disclosure of information.Note: The mod_proxy module is present, but not directly used in a way that exposes this issue to an unauthenticated attacker. There is control plane exposure; however, there is no data plane exposure. This vulnerability is rated as a medium risk for the impacted BIG-IP versions.Security Issue StatusF5 Product Development has assigned IDs 377332 and 549279 to this vulnerability, and has evaluated the currently supported releases for potential vulnerability.To determine if your release is known to be vulnerable, the components or features that are affected by the vulnerability, and for information about releases or hotfixes that address the vulnerability, refer to the following table:ProductVersions known to be vulnerableVersions known to be not vulnerableSeverityVulnerable component or featureBIG-IP LTM10.1.0 - 10.2.412.0.0			11.0.0 - 11.6.0Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)BIG-IP AAMNone12.0.0			11.4.0 - 11.6.0Not vulnerableNoneBIG-IP AFMNone12.0.0			11.3.0 - 11.6.0Not vulnerableNoneBIG-IP AnalyticsNone12.0.0			11.0.0 - 11.6.0Not vulnerableNoneBIG-IP APM10.1.0 - 10.2.412.0.0			11.0.0 - 11.6.0Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)BIG-IP ASM10.1.0 - 10.2.412.0.0			11.0.0 - 11.6.0Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)BIG-IP DNSNone12.0.0Not vulnerableNoneBIG-IP Edge Gateway10.1.0 - 10.2.411.0.0 - 11.3.0Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)BIG-IP GTM10.1.0 - 10.2.411.0.0 - 11.6.0Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)BIG-IP Link Controller10.1.0 - 10.2.412.0.0			11.0.0 - 11.6.0Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)BIG-IP PEMNone12.0.0			11.3.0 - 11.6.0Not vulnerableNoneBIG-IP PSM10.1.0 - 10.2.411.0.0 - 11.4.1Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)BIG-IP WebAccelerator10.1.0 - 10.2.411.0.0 - 11.3.0Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)BIG-IP WOM10.1.0 - 10.2.411.0.0 - 11.3.0Mediumhttpd (Configuration utility, iControl)ARXNone6.0.0 - 6.4.0Not vulnerableNoneEnterprise ManagerNone3.0.0 - 3.1.1Not vulnerableNoneFirePassNone7.0.0			6.0.0 - 6.1.0Not vulnerableNoneBIG-IQ CloudNone4.0.0 - 4.5.0Not vulnerable NoneBIG-IQ DeviceNone4.2.0 - 4.5.0Not vulnerable NoneBIG-IQ SecurityNone4.0.0 - 4.5.0Not vulnerableNoneBIG-IQ ADCNone4.5.0Not vulnerable NoneBIG-IQ Centralized ManagementNone4.6.0Not vulnerableNoneBIG-IQ Cloud and OrchestrationNone1.0.0Not vulnerable NoneLineRateNone2.5.0 - 2.6.1Not vulnerableNoneF5 WebSafeNone1.0.0Not vulnerableNoneTraffix SDCNone4.0.0 - 4.4.0			3.3.2 - 3.5.1Not vulnerableNoneVulnerability Recommended ActionsIf you are running a version listed in the Versions known to be vulnerable column, you can eliminate this vulnerability by upgrading to a version listed in the Versions known to be not vulnerable column.
