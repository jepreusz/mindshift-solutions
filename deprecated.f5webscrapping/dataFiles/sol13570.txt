This behavior occurs because the existing license no longer recognizes the hardware with which it was authorized.RecommendationsWhen the BIG-IP VE virtual machine encounters a license issue after host migration, contact F5 Technical Support to receive authorization to move the license to the new virtual machine.Supplemental Information
