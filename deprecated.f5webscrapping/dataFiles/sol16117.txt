Description


CVE-2013-4292
 
 libvirt 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of domain migrate parameters in certain RPC calls in (1) daemon/remote.c and (2) remote/remote_driver.c.
CVE-2013-4399
 
 The remoteClientFreeFunc function in daemon/remote.c in libvirt before 1.1.3, when ACLs are used, does not set an identity, which causes event handler removal to be denied and remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and crash) by registering an event handler and then closing the connection.
 
CVE-2013-4400
 
 virt-login-shell in libvirt 1.1.2 through 1.1.3 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files and possibly gain privileges via unspecified environment variables or command-line arguments.
 
CVE-2013-6436
 
 The lxcDomainGetMemoryParameters method in lxc/lxc_driver.c in libvirt 1.0.5 through 1.2.0 does not properly check the status of LXC guests when reading memory tunables, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and libvirtd crash) via a guest in the shutdown status, as demonstrated by the "virsh memtune" command.
 
CVE-2013-6457
 
 The libxlDomainGetNumaParameters function in the libxl driver (libxl/libxl_driver.c) in libvirt before 1.2.1 does not properly initialize the nodemap, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid free operation and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an inactive domain to the virsh numatune command.
 
CVE-2014-0179
 
 libvirt 0.7.5 through 1.2.x before 1.2.5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (read block and hang) via a crafted XML document containing an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference to the (1) virConnectCompareCPU or (2) virConnectBaselineCPU API method, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue. NOTE: this issue was SPLIT per ADT3 due to different affected versions of some vectors. CVE-2014-5177 is used for other API methods.
 
CVE-2014-3633
 
 The qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune function in qemu/qemu_driver.c in libvirt before 1.2.9, when a disk has been hot-plugged or removed from the live image, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or read sensitive heap information via a crafted blkiotune query, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.
 
CVE-2014-3657
 
 The virDomainListPopulate function in conf/domain_conf.c in libvirt before 1.2.9 does not clean up the lock on the list of domains, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via a NULL value in the second parameter in the virConnectListAllDomains API command.
 
CVE-2014-5177
 
 libvirt 1.0.0 through 1.2.x before 1.2.5, when fine grained access control is enabled, allows local users to read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document containing an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference to the (1) virDomainDefineXML, (2) virNetworkCreateXML, (3) virNetworkDefineXML, (4) virStoragePoolCreateXML, (5) virStoragePoolDefineXML, (6) virStorageVolCreateXML, (7) virDomainCreateXML, (8) virNodeDeviceCreateXML, (9) virInterfaceDefineXML, (10) virStorageVolCreateXMLFrom, (11) virConnectDomainXMLFromNative, (12) virConnectDomainXMLToNative, (13) virSecretDefineXML, (14) virNWFilterDefineXML, (15) virDomainSnapshotCreateXML, (16) virDomainSaveImageDefineXML, (17) virDomainCreateXMLWithFiles, (18) virConnectCompareCPU, or (19) virConnectBaselineCPU API method, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue. NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2014-0179 per ADT3 due to different affected versions of some vectors.
 
CVE-2014-7823
 
 The virDomainGetXMLDesc API in Libvirt before 1.2.11 allows remote read-only users to obtain the VNC password by using the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_MIGRATABLE flag, which triggers the use of the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE flag.
