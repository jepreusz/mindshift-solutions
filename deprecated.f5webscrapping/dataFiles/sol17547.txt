Known IssueThe Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) may exit when the BIG-IP system processes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) handshakes.This issue occurs when all of the following conditions are met:Your system runs on either of the following platforms:	BIG-IP 2000BIG-IP 4000	The SSL handshake is processed by the crypto acceleration hardware on the platform.This issue can occur when processing SSL handshakes in the crypto acceleration hardware for the affected versions listed. However, this issue is unlikely to occur on versions other than BIG-IP 11.6.0 HF5 or 12.0.0.ImpactDuring SSL handshakes, memory corruption occurs and traffic is disrupted while the tmm process restarts. Systems configured for high availability (HA) fail over to a standby system.SymptomsAs a result of this issue, you may encounter one or more of the following symptoms:The BIG-IP system temporarily fails to process traffic.If configured as part of a high-availability system, the active unit unexpectedly fails over.The BIG-IP system generates a core file to the /shared/core directory.ResolutionStatusF5 Product Development has assigned ID 538255 to this issue.
