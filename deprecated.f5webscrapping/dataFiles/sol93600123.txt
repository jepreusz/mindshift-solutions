Vulnerability DescriptionThe AES-NI implementation in OpenSSL before 1.0.1t and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2h does not consider memory allocation during a certain padding check, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information via a padding-oracle attack against an AES CBC session, NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-0169.

If the table lists only an older version than what you are currently running, or does not list a non-vulnerable version, then no upgrade candidate currently exists.BIG-IPTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider the following recommendations:If SSL profiles are configured to use COMPAT ciphers, consider reconfiguring the profiles to use ciphers from the NATIVE SSL stack.

If the table lists only an older version than what you are currently running, or does not list a non-vulnerable version, then no upgrade candidate currently exists.BIG-IPTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider the following recommendations:If SSL profiles are configured to use COMPAT ciphers, consider reconfiguring the profiles to use ciphers from the NATIVE SSL stack. For information about the NATIVE and COMPAT ciphers, refer to the following articles:SOL13163: SSL ciphers supported on BIG-IP platforms (11.x)SOL13171: Configuring the cipher strength for SSL profiles (11.x)SOL13187: COMPAT SSL ciphers are no longer included in standard cipher stringsTo mitigate this vulnerability for IPsec implementations, you should restrict access to the IPsec tunnel to minimize exposure, and/or consider using an IKE Phase 1 Algorithm other than AES to avoid the vulnerable code.Impact of workaround: F5 recommends testing any such changes in an appropriate environment.To minimize risk, access to the management interface should be restricted to minimize exposure to control-plane daemons.To confirm support for AES-NI, on any running platform, perform the following procedure:Log in to the BIG-IP command line.Determine CPU support for AES-NI instructions by typing the following command:		cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep '^flags' | grep aes		If nothing is returned, the CPU does not support AES-NI, and is therefore not vulnerable.BIG-IQ/Enterprise ManagerTo minimize risk, access to the management interface should be restricted to minimize exposure to control-plane daemons.ARXTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should permit access to the ARX GUI only over a secure network.LineRateTo mitigate this vulnerability, you can disable AES-NI processor support in the BIOS or hypervisor.Impact of workaround: System performance will be negatively impacted by disabling this feature.Supplemental InformationSOL9970: Subscribing to email notifications regarding F5 productsSOL9957: Creating a custom RSS feed to view new and updated documentsSOL4918: Overview of the F5 critical issue hotfix policySOL4602: Overview of the F5 security vulnerability response policySOL167: Downloading software and firmware from F5SOL13123: Managing BIG-IP product hotfixes (11.x - 12.x)SOL9502: BIG-IP hotfix matrix
