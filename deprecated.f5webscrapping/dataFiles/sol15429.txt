Description

Apache Tomcat before 6.0.40, 7.x before 7.0.54, and 8.x before 8.0.6 does not properly constrain the class loader that accesses the XML parser used with an XSLT stylesheet, which allows remote attackers to (1) read arbitrary files via a crafted web application that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, or (2) read files associated with different web applications on a single Tomcat instance via a crafted web application. (CVE-2014-0119)
Impact

An attacker may be able to bypass security-manager restrictions by way of a crafted web application. This vulnerability is considered local, as it is exploitable only by an authenticated user accessing the system using the command line.

Recommended Action
If the previous table lists a version in the Versions known to be not vulnerable column, you can eliminate this vulnerability by upgrading to the listed version. If the table does not list any version in the column, or does not list a version that is higher than the version you are running, then no upgrade candidate currently exists.
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should permit access to the ARX GUI only over a secure network.
