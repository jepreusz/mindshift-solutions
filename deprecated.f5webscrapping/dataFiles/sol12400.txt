Known IssueThe BIG-IP Configuration utility erroneously enables you to assign a health monitor that is configured with a wildcard Alias Service Port (*All Ports) to the following BIG-IP LTM and BIG-IP GTM objects:BIG-IP LTM pools that comprise pool members that are configured with a wildcard service port (*All Services)BIG-IP GTM servers that comprise virtual servers that are configured with a wildcard service portWhen the health monitor is configured with an Alias Service Port setting of *All Ports, the BIG-IP system must use the port defined in the monitored object. If the monitored object is configured with a wildcard service port, the BIG-IP system is unable to determine the port to which monitor traffic should be sent.This issue occurs when all of the following conditions are met:BIG-IP LTMAll pool members of the affected pool have member-specific monitors assigned to each of the members.BIG-IP GTMAll virtual servers of the affected server have member-specific monitors assigned to each of the virtual servers.The correct behavior is for the BIG-IP Configuration utility to prevent this configuration update and display an error message that appears similar to the following example, where <monitor_name> is the name of the health monitor that is configured with a wildcard Alias Service Port:01070622:3: The monitor <monitor_name> has a wildcard destination service and cannot be associated with a node that has a zero service.ImpactThe BIG-IP system fails to pass traffic due to the configuration failing to load.The BIG-IP GTM sync group members may fail to answer wide IP requests.SymptomsAs a result of this issue, you may encounter the following symptoms:BIG-IP LTMBIG-IP iHealth lists Heuristic H863572 on the Diagnostics > Identified > Medium screen.The BIG-IP system has no configuration loaded.When you attempt to load the configuration using commands such as bigpipe load, the command fails with an error message that appears similar to the following:	01070622:3: The monitor <monitor_name> has a wildcard destination service and cannot be associated with a node that has a zero service.	BIG-IP GTMThe configuration gets copied to the BIG-IP GTM peers in the same sync group, but the BIG-IP GTM peers are unable to load the new configuration. Hence, the BIG-IP GTM configuration is out of sync on the BIG-IP GTM peers in the same sync group.The BIG-IP GTM peers log an error message in the /var/log/gtm file. For example:	01070622:3: The monitor <monitor_name> has a wildcard destination service and cannot be associated with a node that has a zero service.

For information about releases or hotfixes that resolve this issue, refer to the following table:Type of FixFixes Introduced InRelated ArticlesReleaseNoneNoneHotfixNoneNoneWorkaroundThere is no workaround for this issue. However, you can avoid this issue by assigning the pool health monitor before assigning a member-specific monitor to each pool member. The pool monitor assignment configuration validates and prevents the system from assigning an inappropriate health monitor to a wildcard destination service.Supplemental InformationSOL8084: Error Message: 01070622:3: The monitor has a wildcard destination service and cannot be associated with a node that has a zero service
