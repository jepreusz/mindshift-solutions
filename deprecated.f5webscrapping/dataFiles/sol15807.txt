The vulnerability described in this article has been resolved, or does not affect any F5 products. There will be no further updates, unless new information is discovered.






Description

curl and libcurl 7.27.0 through 7.35.0, when using the SecureTransport/Darwinssl backend, as used in in Apple OS X 10.9.x before 10.9.2, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate when accessing a URL that uses a numerical IP address, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary valid certificate. (CVE-2014-1263)

Impact
