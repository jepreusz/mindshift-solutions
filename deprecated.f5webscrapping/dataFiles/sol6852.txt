Known IssueThis is the result of a known issue. The output displayed from the netstat command has fixed width columns. The netstat command displays both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses when the netstat -na command is issued. It is possible for IPv6 addresses to be truncated due to the fixed column width.
In the following example, host1 (1111:1110:1001:0000:1234:1234:4567:1111) is connected to host2 (1111:1110:1001:0000:1234:1234:4567:1112) using SSH.
The netstat -na output on host2 displays the following:
tcp 0 0 1111:1110:1001:0:123:22 1111:1110:1001:0::35610 ESTABLISHED
Due to the fixed width columns in the netstat output, both source and destination IPv6 addresses are truncated.
This issue is cosmetic only; it does not affect the performance or network handling of the BIG-IP system.
F5 Product Development tracked this issue as ID 250519 (formerly CR72208).
This issue does not affect BIG-IP 10.1.0 and later.
Note: Beginning in BIG-IP 10.1.0, you can use netstat -T (--notrim) to prevent the utility from truncating the output.
