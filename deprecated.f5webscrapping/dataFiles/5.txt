As a cloud administrator, you create tenants and allocate resources to them in the form of iApps application templates. Tenants can then self-deploy the customized
   application templates to easily define network and application services for several devices,
   without requiring them to perform complicated networking procedures. 

  
The process of providing resources for a tenant includes these tasks:

  

   
Create a user - When you create a user, you assign a name and create a password.

   
Create a tenant - When you create a tenant, you assign a name and specify the connector
    associated with the device(s) on which the cloud resources are hosted. (The system creates and
    associates a custom role to the new tenant.)

   
Associate the user with the with the new tenant's role - You associate a user with a tenant to provide that user
    specific access to cloud resources and self-service customized applications from the
    catalog.

            user.

        
You associate user with a tenant to provide that user specific access to cloud
            resources and self-service applications.

                 This user now has access to all of the resources defined for the
                    associated role.
            



    








    
Disassociating a user from a role

    
    

        
 Use this procedure to disassociate a user from an assigned role.

Click the Save button to save your changes.
