Purpose
You should consider using this procedure under the following condition:

You need to license an Enterprise Manager system.

Prerequisites
You must meet the following prerequisites to use this procedure:

Before you can activate the license for the Enterprise Manager system, you must obtain a base registration key. The base registration key is a 27-character string that indicates to the license server, what F5 products you can license. The base registration key is pre-installed on new Enterprise Manager systems. When you connect to the Configuration utility, the Licensing screen opens and displays the registration key.
 
 If you do not have a base registration key, contact your F5 Sales representative, or F5 Technical Support.
 
 The format of the Enterprise Manager base registration key is as follows:
 
 AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEEEE
The F5 License Server requires a dossier to create a license for the Enterprise Manager system. The dossier is an encrypted list of key characteristics used to identify the platform.
 
 Your F5 product generates the dossier after you choose a license activation method. When choosing the Automatic activation method, the system automatically generates the dossier and submits it to the F5 License Server. When choosing the Manual activation method, the system generates and displays the dossier so you can copy it and manually submit it to the F5 License Server.
 
 The format of the dossier appears similar to the following example:
 
 Note: This sample dossier has been truncated for clarity, and separated into several lines for formatting purposes.
