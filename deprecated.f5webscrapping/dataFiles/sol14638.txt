Vulnerability DescriptionThe RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, has many single-byte biases, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of ciphertext in a large number of sessions that use the same plaintext. (CVE-2013-2566)ImpactRemote attackers may be able to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks using statistical analysis of ciphertext.Security Issue StatusF5 Product Development has assigned ID 430947 (BIG-IP and FirePass) to this vulnerability. In addition, BIG-IP iHealth lists Heuristic H478228 on the Diagnostics > Identified > Medium screen.To determine if your release is known to be vulnerable, the components or features that are affected by the vulnerability, and for information about releases or hotfixes that address the vulnerability, refer to the following table:ProductVersions known to be vulnerableVersions known to be not vulnerableVulnerable component or featureBIG-IP LTM11.0.0 - 11.5.3			10.0.0 - 10.2.4			9.0.0 - 9.6.112.0.0*			11.6.0*Configuration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP AAM11.4.0 - 11.5.312.0.0*			11.6.0*Configuration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP AFM11.3.0 - 11.5.312.0.0*			11.6.0*Configuration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP Analytics11.0.0 - 11.5.312.0.0*			11.6.0*Configuration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP APM11.0.0 - 11.5.3			10.1.0 - 10.2.412.0.0*			11.6.0*Configuration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP ASM11.0.0 - 11.5.3			10.0.0 - 10.2.4			9.2.0 - 9.4.812.0.0*			11.6.0*Configuration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP DNSNone12.0.0*NoneBIG-IP Edge Gateway11.0.0 - 11.3.0			10.1.0 - 10.2.4NoneConfiguration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP GTM11.0.0 - 11.5.3			10.0.0 - 10.2.4			9.2.2 - 9.4.811.6.0*Configuration utilityBIG-IP Link Controller11.0.0 - 11.5.3			10.0.0 - 10.2.4			9.2.2 - 9.4.812.0.0*			11.6.0*Configuration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP PEM11.3.0 - 11.5.312.0.0*			11.6.0*Configuration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP PSM11.0.0 - 11.4.1			10.0.0 - 10.2.4			9.4.5 - 9.4.8NoneConfiguration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP WebAccelerator11.0.0 - 11.3.0			10.0.0 - 10.2.4			9.4.0 - 9.4.8NoneConfiguration utility			SSL virtual serversBIG-IP WOM11.0.0 - 11.3.0			10.0.0 - 10.2.4NoneConfiguration utility			SSL virtual serversARX6.0.0 - 6.4.0			5.0.0 - 5.3.1NoneARX Manager GUI			API (disabled by default)Enterprise Manager3.0.0 - 3.1.1			2.0.0 - 2.3.0			1.6.0 - 1.8.0NoneConfiguration utilityFirePass7.0.0			6.0.0 - 6.1.0None**Administrative interface			WebServicesBIG-IQ Cloud4.0.0 - 4.5.0NoneConfiguration utilityBIG-IQ Security4.0.0 - 4.5.0NoneConfiguration utilityBIG-IQ Device4.2.0 - 4.5.0NoneConfiguration utilityBIG-IQ ADC4.5.0NoneConfiguration utility* Beginning in BIG-IP 11.6.0 and 12.0.0, the RC4 cipher suite is removed from the DEFAULT cipher suite.
