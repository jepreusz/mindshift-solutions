BIG-IQ ADC module terminology

  
  
            

               
Before you manage device resources, it is important that you understand some common
    terms as they are defined within the context of the BIG-IQ速
    ADC module.

                           In the ADC module, you can make configuration changes to a managed device, but
              the changes are not actually applied to the device until you deploy them.

                           In the ADC module, there are two primary modes for interacting with the managed
              device. In this read-only mode, settings that display are from the most recent refresh
              of the managed device.

                           In the ADC module, there are two primary modes for interacting with the managed
              device. In this mode, you can edit any setting for which you have permissions;
              settings that display include any modifications you have made to the managed object
              configuration.

                           In the ADC module, you can refresh the view of the configuration objects for a managed object and get an update of the device statistics.

                           In the ADC module, you can discard any undeployed changes you have made to the configuration objects for a managed object.
