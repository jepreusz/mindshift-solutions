For information about other versions, refer to the following article:SOL6529: Enabling and disabling monitor logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors (9.x - 10.x)You should consider using this procedure under the following condition:To enable or disable monitor logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors.DescriptionTo view detailed information collected by SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors, you can enable SNMP DCA logging on the BIG-IP system. When SNMP DCA logging is enabled, and an SNMP DCA monitor or an SNMP DCA Base monitor is configured to monitor a node, the collected information is logged to the /shared/tmp/snmpdca.log file. The contents of the log file appear similar to the following example:========== /usr/share/monitors/SNMPDCA_monitor ==========Node Address: 10.0.18.1SNMP version: v1, community = public, port: 161Monitor: snmp_dcaAgent Type: UCDUser OIDs:Mem OIDs:.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.4.5.0 - 523904.000000.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.4.6.- 386296.000000Cpu OIDs:.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.11.50.0 - 537468.000000.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.11.52.0 - 364422.000000.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.11.51.0 - 1.000000.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.11.53.0 - 975292152.000000Disk OIDs:.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.9.1 - 54.000000i = 0, util = 26.265881, threshold=70.000000, coeff=1.000000i = 1, util = 0.092388, threshold=80.000000, coeff=1.500000i = 2, util = 54.000000, threshold=90.000000, coeff=2.000000Main:Weight =42 (weight1 = 0.000000, weight2 = 42.021229)PrerequisitesYou must meet the following prerequisite to use this procedure:You must have administrative access to the Traffic Management Shell (tmsh).ProceduresTo enable or disable monitor logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors, perform one the following two procedures:Enable monitor loggingDisable monitor loggingEnable monitor loggingTo enable logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors, perform the following procedure:Impact of procedure: Depending on the number of monitors, number of nodes being monitored, number of objects being collected, and the monitor frequency, the /shared/tmp/log file could grow excessively large. F5 recommends that you enable logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors for only long enough to collect the information you are looking for, and then disable it.Log in to the tmsh utility by typing the following command:	tmsh	Enable monitor logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors by typing the following command:	modify /sys db snmp.snmpdca.log value true	Save the configuration by typing the following command:	save /sys config	Disable monitor loggingTo disable logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors, perform the following procedure:Impact of procedure: Performing the following procedure should not have a negative impact on your system.Log in to the tmsh utility by typing the following command:	tmsh	Disable monitor logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors by typing the following command:	modify /sys db snmp.snmpdca.log value false	Save the configuration by typing the following command:	save /sys config	Supplemental InformationSOL6529: Enabling and disabling monitor logging for SNMP DCA and SNMP DCA Base monitors (9.x - 10.x)SOL14114: Overview of the SNMP DCASOL14110: Creating a custom SNMP DCA or SNMP DCA Base monitorSOL9125: Overview of Dynamic Ratio load balancingSOL6530: Viewing the dynamic ratio weight of a node (9.x - 10.x)SOL14129: Viewing the dynamic ratio weight of a node (11.x - 12.x)
