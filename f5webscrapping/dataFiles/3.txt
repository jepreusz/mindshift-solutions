To deploy the BIG-IQ® Virtual Edition (VE) system on VMware, you perform these tasks:

               

                  
Verify the host machine requirements.

                  
Deploy a BIG-IQ® system as a virtual machine.

                  
Deploy a BIG-IP® system.

                  
After you have deployed the virtual machines, log in to the BIG-IQ VE system
                and run the Setup utility. Using the Setup utility, you perform basic network
                configuration tasks, such as assigning VLANs to interfaces.

                  
Configure secure communication between the BIG-IQ system and the BIG-IP device.

               



            


            

               
Host machine requirements and recommendations

  
  
               

                  
To successfully deploy and run the BIG-IQ® VE system, the host
    system must satisfy minimum requirements.

                  

      
                     
The host system must include these elements:

                     

        
        
        
                        
VMware ESX or ESXi. The Virtual Edition and Supported Hypervisors Matrix, published on the AskF5™ web site, http://support.f5.com identifies
          the versions that are supported.

        
        
        
        
        
        
                        
VMware vSphere™ client

        
        
                        
Connection to a common
          NTP source (this is especially important for each host in a redundant system
          configuration) 

        
        
                     


                     

                        
Important:  The
        hypervisor CPU must meet the following requirements: 
                           
Use a 64-bit architecture.

                           
Have support for virtualization (AMD-V or Intel VT-x) enabled.

                           
Support a one-to-one thread-to-defined virtual CPU ratio, or (on single-threading
            architectures) support at least one core per defined virtual CPU.

                           
Intel processors must be from the Core (or newer) workstation or server family of CPUs.
          

                        


                     


                  


               


            

            

               
Deploying a BIG-IQ VE virtual machine

    
               

                  

                     
The first step in deploying BIG-IQ® Virtual Edition (VE) is to
                download the OVA file to your local system. Next, you can run the Deploy OVF
                Template wizard from within the VMware
                        vSphere™ client.  Follow the steps in this procedure
                to create an instance of the BIG-IQ system that runs as a virtual machine on the
                host system. 

                     

                        
Important: Do not modify the configuration of the VMware guest environment with settings less powerful than the
                ones recommended in this document. This includes the settings for the CPU, RAM, and
                network adapters. Doing so might produce unexpected results.

                  


                  

                     

                        
In a browser, open the F5 Downloads page
                        (https://downloads.f5.com).
                     

                     

                        
Download the BIG-IQ BIG-IQ v4.x/Virtual Edition file package.
                        
There are two options to choose from.
                
                        

                           

                              

                                 
Option
                                 Description
                              

                           

                           

                              

                                 

                                    Large: the file name ends in .LARGE -
                            scsi.ova
                                    
                                 

                                 The large option creates a 500GB disk footprint at installation. This
                            choice supports larger log files required for data analytics.

                              


                              

                                 

                                    Normal: the file name ends in .scsi.ova
                                    
                                 

                                 The standard option creates a 55GB disk footprint at installation. This
                            choice should be the normal working BIG-IQ installation unless 
                            data analytics functionality is required.

                              


                           

                        


                     

                     

                        
Start your vSphere Client and log in. 
                     

                     

                        
From the vSphere Client File menu, choose Deploy OVF Template. 
                        
The Deploy OVF Template wizard starts.
                     

                     

                        
In the Source pane, click Deploy from file or URL, and,
                    using the Browse button, locate the OVF file, open it,
                    and then click Next.
                        
For example:
                            \MyDocuments\Work\Virtualization\<BIG-IQ_OVF_filename>
                        

                        
The OVF Template Details pane opens.
                     

                     

                        
Verify that the OVF template details are correct, and click
                        Next.
                        
This displays the End-User License Agreement (EULA).
                     

                     

                        
Read and accept the license agreement, and click Next. 
                        
The Name and Location pane opens.
                     

                     

                        
In the Name field, type a name for the F5 VE virtual
                    machine, such as: smith_f5_ve.
                     

                     

                        
In the Inventory Location area, select a folder name and click
                        Next.
                     

                     

                        
From the Configuration list, select the number of CPUs
                    and disks required for your system, and then click
                    Next.
                        

                           

                              
Important: Although you can successfully deploy BIG-IQ software with as few as 2
                    CPUs and 4 GB RAM, this configuration should only be used for evaluation purposes. For
                    production use, F5 Networks reccomends either 4 CPUs and 16 GB RAM, or (for higher
                    performance) 8 CPUs and 32 GB RAM.
                        

                     

                     

                        
If the host system is controlled by VMware vCenter™, the
                    Host Cluster screen opens. Choose the preferred host and click
                        Next. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
                     

                     

                        
In the Datastore field, type the name of data source
                    your system will use, in the Available space field, type
                    in the amount of space your system needs (in Gigabytes), and then click
                        Next.
                        
The Network Mapping dialog box opens.
                     

                     

                        
Map the Source Networks to the Destination Networks in your inventory.
                        

                           

                              
Map the source network Management to the name of
                            the appropriate management network in your inventory.
                              
The network used for this interface is usually the same subnet as the
                            vCenter Server, ESXi Host and NSX Manager.
                           


                           

                              
If you choose to manage your BIG-IP devices using an interface other
                            than management, you can map the source network
                                Internal to that non-management network. 
                              
An example of a destination internal network is Private
                                Access.
                           


                           

                              
Leave the source network External at its default
                            setting. This network is not used in most configurations.
                              
An example of a destination external network is Public
                                Access.
                           


                           

                              
When you have the destination networks correctly mapped, click
                                Next.
                              
The Ready to Complete screen opens.
                           


                        



                     

                     

                        
Verify that all deployment settings are correct, and click
                        Finish.
                     

                  


               


               

                  
Powering on the virtual machine

    
                  

                     
You must power on the virtual machine before you
            can begin assigning IP addresses.

                     

                        

                           
In the main vSphere™ client window, click the
                    Administration menu.
                        

                        

                           
Select the virtual machine that you want to power on.
                        

                        

                           
Click the Summary tab, and in the Commands area, click Power
                        On.
                           
The status icon changes to indicate that the virtual machine
                    is on. Note that the system will not process traffic until you configure the
                    virtual machine from its command line or through its web
                    interface.
                        

                     


                  


               

               

                  
Assigning a management IP address to a virtual machine

    
                  

                     
The virtual machine needs an IP address assigned to its virtual management port.
                
                           
Tip: The default configuration for new deployments and installations is
                for DHCP to acquire the management port IP address.
                     


                     

                        

                           
Click the Console tab.
                           
You might need to click the
                    console area and press Enter to activate the console.
                        

                        

                           
At the login prompt, type root.
                        

                        

                           
At the password prompt, type default.
                        

                        

                           
Type config and press Enter.
                           
The F5 Management Port Setup screen opens.
                        

                        

                           
Click OK.
                        

                        

                           
If you want DHCP to automatically assign an address for the management port,
                    select Yes. Otherwise, select No
                    and follow the instructions for manually assigning an IP address and netmask for
                    the management port.
                        

                     


                     
When assigned, the management IP address appears in the Summary tab of the vSphere™ client. Alternatively, you can use a hypervisor generic
            statement to determine your management  address; such as: tmsh list sys
                management-ip.

                     

                        

                           
Tip: F5 Networks® highly recommends that you specify a default route for the
                virtual management port, but it is not required for operation of the virtual
                machine.

                     


                  


               

            

         

      







         

 
         

  
 


         

            
About VE VMware deployment

    
            

               
To deploy the BIG-IQ® Virtual Edition (VE) system on VMware, you perform these tasks:

               

                  
Verify the host machine requirements.

                  
Deploy a BIG-IQ® system as a virtual machine.

                  
Deploy a BIG-IP® system.

                  
After you have deployed the virtual machines, log in to the BIG-IQ VE system
                and run the Setup utility. Using the Setup utility, you perform basic network

Host machine requirements and recommendations

  
  
               

                  
To successfully deploy and run the BIG-IQ® VE system, the host
    system must satisfy minimum requirements.

                  

      
                     
The host system must include these elements:

                     

        
        
        
                        
VMware ESX or ESXi. The Virtual Edition and Supported Hypervisors Matrix, published on the AskF5™ web site, http://support.f5.com identifies
          the versions that are supported.

        
        
        
        
        
        
                        
VMware vSphere™ client

        
        
                        
Connection to a common
          NTP source (this is especially important for each host in a redundant system
          configuration) 

        
        
                     


                     

                        
Important:  The
        hypervisor CPU must meet the following requirements: 
                           
Use a 64-bit architecture.

                           
Have support for virtualization (AMD-V or Intel VT-x) enabled.

                           
Support a one-to-one thread-to-defined virtual CPU ratio, or (on single-threading
            architectures) support at least one core per defined virtual CPU.

                           
Intel processors must be from the Core (or newer) workstation or server family of CPUs.
          

                        


                     


                  


               


            

            

               
Deploying a BIG-IQ VE virtual machine

    
               

                  

                     
The first step in deploying BIG-IQ® Virtual Edition (VE) is to
                download the OVA file to your local system. Next, you can run the Deploy OVF
                Template wizard from within the VMware
                        vSphere™ client.  Follow the steps in this procedure
                to create an instance of the BIG-IQ system that runs as a virtual machine on the
                host system. 

                     

                        
Important: Do not modify the configuration of the VMware guest environment with settings less powerful than the
                ones recommended in this document. This includes the settings for the CPU, RAM, and
                network adapters. Doing so might produce unexpected results.

                  


                  

                     

                        
In a browser, open the F5 Downloads page
                        (https://downloads.f5.com).
                     

                     

                        
Download the BIG-IQ BIG-IQ v4.x/Virtual Edition file package.
                        
There are two options to choose from.
                
                        

                           

                              

                                 
Option
                                 Description
                              

                           

                           

                              

                                 

                                    Large: the file name ends in .LARGE -
                            scsi.ova
                                    
                                 

                                 The large option creates a 500GB disk footprint at installation. This
                            choice supports larger log files required for data analytics.

                              


                              

                                 

                                    Normal: the file name ends in .scsi.ova
                                    
                                 

                                 The standard option creates a 55GB disk footprint at installation. This
                            choice should be the normal working BIG-IQ installation unless 
                            data analytics functionality is required.

                              


                           

                        


                     

                     

                        
Start your vSphere Client and log in. 
                     

                     

                        
From the vSphere Client File menu, choose Deploy OVF Template. 
                        
The Deploy OVF Template wizard starts.
                     

                     

                        
In the Source pane, click Deploy from file or URL, and,
                    using the Browse button, locate the OVF file, open it,
                    and then click Next.
                        
For example:
                            \MyDocuments\Work\Virtualization\<BIG-IQ_OVF_filename>
                        

                        
The OVF Template Details pane opens.
                     

                     

                        
Verify that the OVF template details are correct, and click
                        Next.
                        
This displays the End-User License Agreement (EULA).
                     

                     

                        
Read and accept the license agreement, and click Next. 
                        
The Name and Location pane opens.
                     

                     

                        
In the Name field, type a name for the F5 VE virtual
                    machine, such as: smith_f5_ve.
                     

                     

                        
In the Inventory Location area, select a folder name and click
                        Next.
                     

                     

                        
From the Configuration list, select the number of CPUs
                    and disks required for your system, and then click
                    Next.
                        

                           

                              
Important: Although you can successfully deploy BIG-IQ software with as few as 2
                    CPUs and 4 GB RAM, this configuration should only be used for evaluation purposes. For
                    production use, F5 Networks reccomends either 4 CPUs and 16 GB RAM, or (for higher
                    performance) 8 CPUs and 32 GB RAM.
                        

                     

                     

                        
If the host system is controlled by VMware vCenter™, the
                    Host Cluster screen opens. Choose the preferred host and click
                        Next. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
                     

                     

                        
In the Datastore field, type the name of data source
                    your system will use, in the Available space field, type
                    in the amount of space your system needs (in Gigabytes), and then click
                        Next.
                        
The Network Mapping dialog box opens.
                     

                     

                        
Map the Source Networks to the Destination Networks in your inventory.
                        

                           

                              
Map the source network Management to the name of
                            the appropriate management network in your inventory.
                              
The network used for this interface is usually the same subnet as the
                            vCenter Server, ESXi Host and NSX Manager.
                           


                           

                              
If you choose to manage your BIG-IP devices using an interface other
                            than management, you can map the source network
                                Internal to that non-management network. 
                              
An example of a destination internal network is Private
                                Access.
                           


                           

                              
Leave the source network External at its default
                            setting. This network is not used in most configurations.
                              
An example of a destination external network is Public
                                Access.
                           


                           

                              
When you have the destination networks correctly mapped, click
                                Next.
                              
The Ready to Complete screen opens.
                           


                        



                     

                     

                        
Verify that all deployment settings are correct, and click
                        Finish.
                     

                  


               


               

                  
Powering on the virtual machine

    
                  

                     
You must power on the virtual machine before you
            can begin assigning IP addresses.

                     

                        

                           
In the main vSphere™ client window, click the
                    Administration menu.
                        

                        

                           
Select the virtual machine that you want to power on.
                        

                        

                           
Click the Summary tab, and in the Commands area, click Power
                        On.
                           
The status icon changes to indicate that the virtual machine
                    is on. Note that the system will not process traffic until you configure the
                    virtual machine from its command line or through its web
                    interface.
                        

                     


                  


               

               

                  
Assigning a management IP address to a virtual machine

    
                  

                     
The virtual machine needs an IP address assigned to its virtual management port.
                
                           
Tip: The default configuration for new deployments and installations is
                for DHCP to acquire the management port IP address.
                     


                     

                        

                           
Click the Console tab.
                           
You might need to click the
                    console area and press Enter to activate the console.
                        

                        

                           
At the login prompt, type root.
                        

                        

                           
At the password prompt, type default.
                        

                        

                           
Type config and press Enter.
                           
The F5 Management Port Setup screen opens.
                        

                        

                           
Click OK.
                        

                        

                           
If you want DHCP to automatically assign an address for the management port,
                    select Yes. Otherwise, select No
                    and follow the instructions for manually assigning an IP address and netmask for
                    the management port.
                        

                     


                     
When assigned, the management IP address appears in the Summary tab of the vSphere™ client. Alternatively, you can use a hypervisor generic
            statement to determine your management  address; such as: tmsh list sys
                management-ip.

                     

                        

                           
Tip: F5 Networks® highly recommends that you specify a default route for the
                virtual management port, but it is not required for operation of the virtual
                machine.

                     


                  


               

            

         

      







         

 
         

  
 


         

            
About VE VMware deployment

    
            

               
To deploy the BIG-IQ® Virtual Edition (VE) system on VMware, you perform these tasks:

               

                  
Verify the host machine requirements.

                  
Deploy a BIG-IQ® system as a virtual machine.

                  
Deploy a BIG-IP® system.

                  
After you have deployed the virtual machines, log in to the BIG-IQ VE system
                and run the Setup utility. Using the Setup utility, you perform basic network
                configuration tasks, such as assigning VLANs to interfaces.

                  
Configure secure communication between the BIG-IQ system and the BIG-IP device.

          the versions that are supported.

        
        
        
        
        
        
                        
VMware vSphere™ client

        
        
                        
Connection to a common
          NTP source (this is especially important for each host in a redundant system
          configuration) 

        
        
                     


                     

                        
Important:  The
        hypervisor CPU must meet the following requirements: 
                           
Use a 64-bit architecture.

                           
Have support for virtualization (AMD-V or Intel VT-x) enabled.

                           
Support a one-to-one thread-to-defined virtual CPU ratio, or (on single-threading
            architectures) support at least one core per defined virtual CPU.

                           
Intel processors must be from the Core (or newer) workstation or server family of CPUs.
          

                        


                     


                  


               


            

            

               
Deploying a BIG-IQ VE virtual machine

    
               

                  

                     
The first step in deploying BIG-IQ® Virtual Edition (VE) is to
                download the OVA file to your local system. Next, you can run the Deploy OVF
                Template wizard from within the VMware
                        vSphere™ client.  Follow the steps in this procedure
                to create an instance of the BIG-IQ system that runs as a virtual machine on the
                host system. 

                     

                        
Important: Do not modify the configuration of the VMware guest environment with settings less powerful than the
                ones recommended in this document. This includes the settings for the CPU, RAM, and
                network adapters. Doing so might produce unexpected results.

                  


                  

                     

                        
In a browser, open the F5 Downloads page
                        (https://downloads.f5.com).
                     

                     

                        
Download the BIG-IQ BIG-IQ v4.x/Virtual Edition file package.
                        
There are two options to choose from.
                
                        

                           

                              

                                 
Option
                                 Description
                              

                           

                           

                              

                                 

                                    Large: the file name ends in .LARGE -
                            scsi.ova
                                    
                                 

                                 The large option creates a 500GB disk footprint at installation. This
                            choice supports larger log files required for data analytics.

                              


                              

                                 

                                    Normal: the file name ends in .scsi.ova
                                    
                                 

                                 The standard option creates a 55GB disk footprint at installation. This
                            choice should be the normal working BIG-IQ installation unless 
                            data analytics functionality is required.

                              


                           

                        


                     

                     

                        
Start your vSphere Client and log in. 
                     

                     

                        
From the vSphere Client File menu, choose Deploy OVF Template. 
                        
The Deploy OVF Template wizard starts.
                     

                     

                        
In the Source pane, click Deploy from file or URL, and,
                    using the Browse button, locate the OVF file, open it,
                    and then click Next.
                        
For example:
                            \MyDocuments\Work\Virtualization\<BIG-IQ_OVF_filename>
                        

                        
The OVF Template Details pane opens.
                     

                     

                        
Verify that the OVF template details are correct, and click
                        Next.
                        
This displays the End-User License Agreement (EULA).
                     

                     

                        
Read and accept the license agreement, and click Next. 
                        
The Name and Location pane opens.
                     

                     

                        
In the Name field, type a name for the F5 VE virtual
                    machine, such as: smith_f5_ve.
                     

                     

                        
In the Inventory Location area, select a folder name and click
                        Next.
                     

                     

                        
From the Configuration list, select the number of CPUs
                    and disks required for your system, and then click
                    Next.
                        

                           

                              
Important: Although you can successfully deploy BIG-IQ software with as few as 2
                    CPUs and 4 GB RAM, this configuration should only be used for evaluation purposes. For
                    production use, F5 Networks reccomends either 4 CPUs and 16 GB RAM, or (for higher
                    performance) 8 CPUs and 32 GB RAM.
                        

                     

                     

                        
If the host system is controlled by VMware vCenter™, the
                    Host Cluster screen opens. Choose the preferred host and click
                        Next. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
                     

                     

                        
In the Datastore field, type the name of data source
                    your system will use, in the Available space field, type
                    in the amount of space your system needs (in Gigabytes), and then click
                        Next.
                        
The Network Mapping dialog box opens.
                     

                     

                        
Map the Source Networks to the Destination Networks in your inventory.
                        

                           

                              
Map the source network Management to the name of
                            the appropriate management network in your inventory.
                              
The network used for this interface is usually the same subnet as the
                            vCenter Server, ESXi Host and NSX Manager.
                           


                           

                              
If you choose to manage your BIG-IP devices using an interface other
                            than management, you can map the source network
                                Internal to that non-management network. 
                              
An example of a destination internal network is Private
                                Access.
                           


                           

                              
Leave the source network External at its default
                            setting. This network is not used in most configurations.
                              
An example of a destination external network is Public
                                Access.
                           


                           

                              
When you have the destination networks correctly mapped, click
                                Next.
                              
The Ready to Complete screen opens.
                           


                        



                     

                     

                        
Verify that all deployment settings are correct, and click
                        Finish.
                     

                  


               


               

                  
Powering on the virtual machine

    
                  

                     
You must power on the virtual machine before you
            can begin assigning IP addresses.

                     

                        

                           
In the main vSphere™ client window, click the
                    Administration menu.
                        

                        

                           
Select the virtual machine that you want to power on.
                        

                        

                           
Click the Summary tab, and in the Commands area, click Power
                        On.
                           
The status icon changes to indicate that the virtual machine
                    is on. Note that the system will not process traffic until you configure the
                    virtual machine from its command line or through its web
                    interface.
                        

                     


                  


               

               

                  
Assigning a management IP address to a virtual machine

    
                  

                     
The virtual machine needs an IP address assigned to its virtual management port.
                
                           
Tip: The default configuration for new deployments and installations is
                for DHCP to acquire the management port IP address.
                     


                     

                        

                           
Click the Console tab.
                           
You might need to click the
                    console area and press Enter to activate the console.
                        

                        

                           
At the login prompt, type root.
                        

                        

                           
At the password prompt, type default.
                        

                        

                           
Type config and press Enter.
                           
The F5 Management Port Setup screen opens.
                        

                        

                           
Click OK.
                        

                        

                           
If you want DHCP to automatically assign an address for the management port,
                    select Yes. Otherwise, select No
                    and follow the instructions for manually assigning an IP address and netmask for
                    the management port.
                        

                     


                     
When assigned, the management IP address appears in the Summary tab of the vSphere™ client. Alternatively, you can use a hypervisor generic
            statement to determine your management  address; such as: tmsh list sys
                management-ip.

                     

                        

                           
Tip: F5 Networks® highly recommends that you specify a default route for the
                virtual management port, but it is not required for operation of the virtual
                machine.
