A user is an individual to whom you provide resources. You provide access to users
   for specific BIG-IQ® system functionality through authentication. You can
   associate a user with a specific role, or associate a user with a user group and then associate
   the group with a role. 

               
A role is defined by its specific privileges. A user group is a group
   of individuals that have access to the same resources. When you associate a role with a user or
   user group, that user or user group is granted all of the role's corresponding privileges. 

               
By default, the BIG-IQ® system provides the following default user
   types:

               

   
                  

                     

     
     
     
                        

                           

                              
Default user type

                              Default password

                              Access rights

                           


                        


                        

                           

                              
admin

                              admin

                              This user type can access all aspects of the BIG-IQ system from the system's user
        interface.

                           


                           

                              
root

                              default

                              This user has access to all aspects of the BIG-IQ system from the system's console
        command line.

                           


                        


                     

                  


               


               
User types persist and are available after a BIG-IQ system failover.
   

            


            

               
About default passwords for pre-defined users

 
               

                  
When you initially license the BIG-IQ® system, it creates the following
   administrative roles with a default password.

                  

                     
admin

                     
root

                  


               


            

            

               
Changing the default password for the administrator user

    
               

                  
You must specify the management IP address settings for the BIG-IQ® system to prompt the system to automatically create the administrator
            user.

                  
After you initially license and configure the BIG-IQ system, it is important to
            change the administrator role password from the default, admin. 

                  

                     

                        
Log in to BIG-IQ® Cloud with the administrator user name and
                    password.

Adding a locally-authenticated BIG-IQ user

    
               

                  
You create a user so you can then associate that user with a particular role to
            define access to specific BIG-IQ® system resources. 

                  

                     

                        
Log in to BIG-IQ® Cloud with the administrator user name and
                    password.
                     

                     

                        
 At the top of the screen, click Access Control.
                     

                     

                        
 In the Users panel, hover over a user, and click the gear icon when it
                    appears.
                        
The panel expands to display the User properties.
                     

                     

                        
 From the Auth Type Provider list, select
                        Local.
                     

                     

                        
 In the Full Name field, type a name to identify this
                    user.

About user roles

 
            

               
As a system manager, you need a way to differentiate between users and to limit user privileges
   based on their responsibilities. To assist you, the BIG-IQ® system has
   created a default set of roles you can assign to a user. Roles persist and are available after a
   BIG-IQ system failover. 

            


            

               
Roles definitions


  
  
               

                  
BIG-IQ® system ships with several standard roles, which you can
    assign to individual users.

    
                  

                     

                        

                           

                              
Role

                              Description

                           


                        


                        

                           

                              
Administrator

                              Responsible for overall administration of all licensed aspects of the BIG-IQ
              system. These responsibilities include adding individual users, assigning roles,
              discovering BIG-IP® systems, installing updates, activating
              licenses, and configuring a BIG-IQ high availability (HA) configuration.

                           


                           

                              
Tenant

                              A tenant is an entity that can consist of one or more users accessing resources
              provided by an administrator. Responsibilities include: customizing and deploying
              application templates, and monitoring the health statistics and performance of
              applications and servers. 
                                    
Note: The BIG-IQ system creates a new role when
                an administrator creates a new tenant. The connectors each tenant can access are
                specified when the tenant is created. The name of the new role is based on the
                tenant name. For example, creating a new tenant named
                  headquarters-user, produces a new role named
                  headquarters-user (Cloud Tenant). 

                              


                           



                        


                     

                  


               


            

            

               
Associating a user or user group with a role 

    
               

                  
Before you can associate a user or user group with a role, you must create a user or
            user group.

                  
When you associate a user or user group with a role, you define the resources users
            can view and modify. You can associate multiple roles with a given user.




                  

                     

                        
Log in to BIG-IQ® Cloud with the administrator user name and
                    password.

 In the Users or User Groups panel, click the name you want to associate with a
                    role, and drag and drop it on a role in the Roles panel.
                        
A confirmation pop-up screen opens.
                     

                     

                        
Click the Confirm button to assign the user or user group to the selected role.
                     

                  


                  
This user or user group now has access to the resources associated with the role you
            specified.

This user no longer has the privileges associated with the role you
            deleted.

               


            

         

      







         

 
         


         

            
Overview: Users, user groups, and roles

 
            

               
A user is an individual to whom you provide resources. You provide access to users
   for specific BIG-IQ® system functionality through authentication. You can
   associate a user with a specific role, or associate a user with a user group and then associate
   the group with a role. 

               
A role is defined by its specific privileges. A user group is a group
   of individuals that have access to the same resources. When you associate a role with a user or
   user group, that user or user group is granted all of the role's corresponding privileges. 

               
By default, the BIG-IQ® system provides the following default user
   types:

About default passwords for pre-defined users

 
               

                  
When you initially license the BIG-IQ® system, it creates the following
   administrative roles with a default password.

                  

                     
admin

Changing the default password for the administrator user

    
               

                  
You must specify the management IP address settings for the BIG-IQ® system to prompt the system to automatically create the administrator
            user.

                  
After you initially license and configure the BIG-IQ system, it is important to
            change the administrator role password from the default, admin.

About user roles

 
            

               
As a system manager, you need a way to differentiate between users and to limit user privileges
   based on their responsibilities. To assist you, the BIG-IQ® system has
   created a default set of roles you can assign to a user. Roles persist and are available after a
   BIG-IQ system failover. 

            


            

               
Roles definitions


  
  
               

                  
BIG-IQ® system ships with several standard roles, which you can
    assign to individual users.

    
                  

                     

                        

                           

                              
Role

                              Description

                           


                        


                        

                           

                              
Administrator

                              Responsible for overall administration of all licensed aspects of the BIG-IQ
              system. These responsibilities include adding individual users, assigning roles,
              discovering BIG-IP® systems, installing updates, activating
              licenses, and configuring a BIG-IQ high availability (HA) configuration.

                           


                           

                              
Tenant

                              A tenant is an entity that can consist of one or more users accessing resources
              provided by an administrator. Responsibilities include: customizing and deploying
              application templates, and monitoring the health statistics and performance of
              applications and servers. 
                                    
Note: The BIG-IQ system creates a new role when
                an administrator creates a new tenant. The connectors each tenant can access are
                specified when the tenant is created. The name of the new role is based on the
                tenant name. For example, creating a new tenant named
                  headquarters-user, produces a new role named
                  headquarters-user (Cloud Tenant). 

                              


                           



                        


                     

                  


               


            

            

               
Associating a user or user group with a role 

    
               

                  
Before you can associate a user or user group with a role, you must create a user or
            user group.

                  
When you associate a user or user group with a role, you define the resources users
            can view and modify. You can associate multiple roles with a given user.

This user or user group now has access to the resources associated with the role you
            specified.

Overview: Users, user groups, and roles

 
            

               
A user is an individual to whom you provide resources. You provide access to users
   for specific BIG-IQ® system functionality through authentication. You can
   associate a user with a specific role, or associate a user with a user group and then associate
   the group with a role. 

               
A role is defined by its specific privileges. A user group is a group
   of individuals that have access to the same resources. When you associate a role with a user or
   user group, that user or user group is granted all of the role's corresponding privileges. 

               
By default, the BIG-IQ® system provides the following default user
   types:

               

   
                  

                     

     
     
     
                        

                           

                              
Default user type

                              Default password

                              Access rights

                           


                        


                        

                           

                              
admin

                              admin

                              This user type can access all aspects of the BIG-IQ system from the system's user
        interface.

                           


                           

                              
root

                              default

                              This user has access to all aspects of the BIG-IQ system from the system's console
        command line.

                           


                        


                     

                  


               


               
User types persist and are available after a BIG-IQ system failover.
   

            


            

               
About default passwords for pre-defined users

 
               

                  
When you initially license the BIG-IQ® system, it creates the following
   administrative roles with a default password.

                  

                     
admin

                     
root

                  


               


            

            

               
Changing the default password for the administrator user

    
               

                  
You must specify the management IP address settings for the BIG-IQ® system to prompt the system to automatically create the administrator
            user.

                  
After you initially license and configure the BIG-IQ system, it is important to
            change the administrator role password from the default, admin. 

                  

                     

                        
Log in to BIG-IQ® Cloud with the administrator user name and
                    password.
                     

                     

                        

                    At the top of the screen, click Access Control.

              licenses, and configuring a BIG-IQ high availability (HA) configuration.

                           


                           

                              
Tenant

                              A tenant is an entity that can consist of one or more users accessing resources
              provided by an administrator. Responsibilities include: customizing and deploying
              application templates, and monitoring the health statistics and performance of
              applications and servers. 
                                    
Note: The BIG-IQ system creates a new role when
                an administrator creates a new tenant. The connectors each tenant can access are
                specified when the tenant is created. The name of the new role is based on the
                tenant name. For example, creating a new tenant named
                  headquarters-user, produces a new role named
                  headquarters-user (Cloud Tenant). 

                              


                           



                        


                     

                  


               


            

            

               
Associating a user or user group with a role 

    
               

                  
Before you can associate a user or user group with a role, you must create a user or
            user group.

                  
When you associate a user or user group with a role, you define the resources users
            can view and modify. You can associate multiple roles with a given user.
