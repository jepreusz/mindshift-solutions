You should consider using this procedure under the following conditions:

You want to activate and install a new license using the command line.
You want to activate and install a license containing one or more add-on registration keys using the command line.
You want to re-activate and install an existing license using the command line.

DescriptionTo locate the registration key, or to activate or re-activate a BIG-IP license and install the license file using the command line, perform one of the following procedures.Note: Traffic processing will be briefly interrupted as the BIG-IP system reloads the new license. F5 recommends that you perform the following procedures on the standby BIG-IP device.PrerequisitesYou must meet the following prerequisites to use this procedure:You have command line access to the BIG-IP system.You are familiar with a Linux text editor, such as vi or nano.You know the product registration key that was provided to you when you purchased the F5 product.	The base registration key is a 27-character string that appears similar to the following example:	ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDEFG	The add-on registration key is a shorter string of characters that appears similar to the following example:	ABCDEFG-ABCDEFG	ProceduresLocating the registration key on an unlicensed systemImpact of procedure: Performing the following procedure should not have a negative impact on your system.Log in to the command line on the standby BIG-IP device.Type the one of the following commands as appropriate for your platform:	For non-VIPRION platforms:	cat /config/RegKey.license	For VIPRION platforms:	tmsh show /sys hardware | grep 'Registration Key'	Note: Registration keys for RMA devices will be sent in an email from F5. For more information about the F5 RMA process, refer to: SOL12882: Overview of the F5 RMA process.Note: Registration keys for BIG-IP Virtual Editions (VE) are purchased and obtained through the following websites:F5 trial website F5 salesLocating the registration key on a previously licensed systemImpact of procedure: Performing the following procedure should not have a negative impact on your system.Log in to the command line on the standby BIG-IP device.Type the following command:	grep -i "Registration Key" /config/bigip.license	Activating and installing a license using the command lineImpact of procedure: Traffic processing will be briefly interrupted as the BIG-IP system reloads the new license. F5 recommends that you perform this procedure on the standby device.Note: For VIPRION systems, you should perform this procedure on a primary blade. The license registration key will be propagated to the secondary blades on the BIG-IP system once the primary blade is activated.Log in to the command line on the standby BIG-IP device.Back up the existing license by typing the following command:	cp /config/bigip.license /config/bigip.license.sol2595	Truncate the existing license file by typing the following command:	>/config/bigip.license	Note: The previous command results in an empty /config/bigip.license file. In the following steps, you will populate the empty /config/bigip.license file with an updated copy of the BIG-IP license.	Type the get_dossier command in conjunction with the registration key, by using one of the following syntax examples:	When activating a new license, specify only the base registration key in the get_dossier command.		For example:		get_dossier -b ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDEFG		When activating a new license that includes an add-on registration key, specify the base registration key and an add-on registration key in the get_dossier command.		For example, a license activation with an add-on key ABCDEFG-ABCDEFG:		get_dossier -b ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDEFG -a ABCDEFG-ABCDEFG				Or license activation with multiple add-on keys ABCDEFG-ABCDEFG and ABCDEFG-BBBBBBB:				get_dossier -b ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDEFG -a ABCDEFG-ABCDEFG,ABCDEFG-BBBBBBB		When re-activating any existing license (including a license with an add-on registration key), specify only the base registration key in the get_dossier command.		For example:		get_dossier -b ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDEFG		When reactivating an existing license, and deactivating an expired evaluation license key, specify the base registration key and add-on (if any,) and use the -i option for the expired evaluation license key in the get_dossier command.				For example, if the expired evaluation license key is ABCDEFG-ZZZZZZZ:				get_dossier -b ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDE-ABCDEFG -a ABCDEFG-ABCDEFG -i ABCDEFG-ZZZZZZZ				Note: In each case, replace the example registration key with the registration key that you received when you purchased your F5 product.
