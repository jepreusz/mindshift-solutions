Known IssueThis is the result of a known issue. In BIG-IP ASM 10.2.0, if you enable both the Web Scraping Prevention feature and the cross-site request forgery (CSRF) Protection feature on the same policy, the system may produce incorrectly-formatted HTTP responses, which may render HTML and JavaScript as plain text, or otherwise cause the page to render incorrectly. The following markup code segments are examples of how the system may incorrectly render markup code as readable text in the body of a web page:<script type="text/javascript" src="http://i.subdomain.domain.tld/dir/.element/js/2.0/frame.js"><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"><meta content="yes" name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" /> Note: The above code fragments are only examples. The exact markup code displayed will vary depending on what web object the system serves in the response. F5 Product Development tracked this issue as ID328776 (formerly CR139549) and it was fixed in BIG-IP ASM 10.2.1. For information about upgrading, refer to the BIG-IP ASM release notes.
