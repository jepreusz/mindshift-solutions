Before you can upgrade F5®
      BIG-IQ® Centralized Management, you must perform each of the following
      procedures.

    
    
                  

                     

        
        
                        

                           

                              
Required Procedures

                              Notes

                           


                        


                        

                           

                              
Re-activate the BIG-IQ system license. 

                              You must do this on both the active and the standby BIG-IQ if they are running in
              an HA pair. For specific instructions about how to reactivate a license, refer to the
                  F5®
                BIG-IQ® Central Management: Licensing and Initial Setup
              guide.

                           


                           

                              
Create a UCS backup of the BIG-IQ system's current configuration and store it on
              a remote server.

                              You can use this backup in the event you want to restore BIG-IQ version
              5.0.

                           


                           

                              
Decide which disk volume you want to install the upgrade on. You must have at
              least two volumes to upgrade BIG-IQ. 

                              If you are running BIG-IQ Virtual Edition and you don't have two volumes, refer
              to: SOL17406: Using the tmsh utility to create a new software volume for installing a
              new image or hotfix on the BIG-IQ system at:

Before
      upgrading BIG-IQ, download the BIG-IQ version 5.1 .iso image from the F5
      downloads site.

                  

                     

                        
Warning: These procedures require
        that the BIG-IQ system is temporarily unavailable and unable to manage BIG-IP® devices until the upgrade is complete. BIG-IP devices can continue to manage
        traffic during this time.

                     
The upgrade process involves installing the new version of the software, booting into that
        new version, and reviewing the settings on the setup screens.

Important: In the unlikely event
        that you are unable to log in to a BIG-IQ® 7000 series platform after
        you upgraded it, refer to SOL40338232: The BIG-IQ system interface might be
          inaccessible after the BIG-IQ system is upgraded from BIG-IQ Centralized Management
          version to 5.1.0  at

Upgrade the secondary BIG-IQ version 5.0
        to BIG-IQ version 5.1

    
               

                  

                     
After you upgrade the primary BIG-IQ® Centralized Management system to version 5.1 and
                discover and import services for your managed devices, you can upgrade the secondary
                BIG-IQ system in a HA configuration. 
You need at least two volumes to upgrade
            BIG-IQ. If you are running BIG-IQ Virtual Edition and you don't have two volumes, refer
            to: SOL17406: Using the tmsh utility to create a new software volume for
                installing a new image or hotfix on the BIG-IQ system at
                support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/17000/400/sol17406.html
                  


                  
You upgrade the secondary BIG-IQ in
            a HA configuration so it is running the same software version as the primary
            BIG-IQ.

Re-activate the BIG-IQ system license. 

                              You must do this on both the active and the standby BIG-IQ if they are running in
              an HA pair. For specific instructions about how to reactivate a license, refer to the
                  F5®

Create a UCS backup of the BIG-IQ system's current configuration and store it on
              a remote server.

                              You can use this backup in the event you want to restore BIG-IQ version
              5.0.

                           


                           

                              
Decide which disk volume you want to install the upgrade on. You must have at
              least two volumes to upgrade BIG-IQ. 

                              If you are running BIG-IQ Virtual Edition and you don't have two volumes, refer
              to: SOL17406: Using the tmsh utility to create a new software volume for installing a
              new image or hotfix on the BIG-IQ system at:

You can now upgrade the primary
            BIG-IQ.

               


            

            

  
               
Upgrade the primary BIG-IQ version 5.0 to
    BIG-IQ version 5.1

  
               

                  

                     
You need at least two volumes to
        upgrade F5®
        BIG-IQ® Centralized Management. If you are running BIG-IQ Virtual
        Edition and don't have two volumes, refer to: SOL17406: Using the tmsh utility to
          create a new software volume for installing a new image or hotfix on the BIG-IQ
          system at
          support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/17000/400/sol17406.html
                     

Before
      upgrading BIG-IQ, download the BIG-IQ version 5.1 .iso image from the F5
      downloads site.

                  

                     

                        
Warning: These procedures require
        that the BIG-IQ system is temporarily unavailable and unable to manage BIG-IP® devices until the upgrade is complete. BIG-IP devices can continue to manage
        traffic during this time.

                     
The upgrade process involves installing the new version of the software, booting into that
        new version, and reviewing the settings on the setup screens.
