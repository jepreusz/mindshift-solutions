Vulnerability DescriptionCVE-2016-7128	The exif_process_IFD_in_TIFF function in ext/exif/exif.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 mishandles the case of a thumbnail offset that exceeds the file size, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via a crafted TIFF image.	CVE-2016-7129	The php_wddx_process_data function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an invalid ISO 8601 time value, as demonstrated by a wddx_deserialize call that mishandles a dateTime element in a wddxPacket XML document.	CVE-2016-7130	The php_wddx_pop_element function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an invalid base64 binary value, as demonstrated by a wddx_deserialize call that mishandles a binary element in a wddxPacket XML document.	CVE-2016-7131	ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed wddxPacket XML document that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call, as demonstrated by a tag that lacks a &lt; (less than) character.	CVE-2016-7132	ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an invalid wddxPacket XML document that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call, as demonstrated by a stray element inside a boolean element, leading to incorrect pop processing.	CVE-2016-7133	Zend/zend_alloc.c in PHP 7.x before 7.0.10, when open_basedir is enabled, mishandles huge realloc operations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long pathname.	CVE-2016-7134	ext/curl/interface.c in PHP 7.x before 7.0.10 does not work around a libcurl integer overflow, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (allocation error and heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string that is mishandled in a curl_escape call.
