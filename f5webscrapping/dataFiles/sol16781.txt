The vulnerability described in this article has been resolved, or does not affect any F5 products. There will be no further updates, unless new information is discovered.






Description

include/linux/netdevice.h in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36 incorrectly uses macros for netdev_printk and its related logging implementation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) by sending invalid packets to a VxLAN interface. (CVE-2014-3535)
Impact
There is no impact; F5 products are not affected by this vulnerability.
Status
F5 Product Development has assigned ID 479429 (BIG-IP), ID 480424 (BIG-IQ), ID 480425 (Enterprise Manager) and ID 461496 (ARX) to this vulnerability.
