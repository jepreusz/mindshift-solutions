Description

packet.c in ssh in OpenSSH allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending an invalid protocol sequence with USERAUTH_SUCCESS before NEWKEYS, which causes newkeys[mode] to be NULL. (CVE-2006-4925)

Impact


An attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

Recommended action
If the previous table lists a version in the Versions known to be not vulnerable column, you can eliminate this vulnerability by upgrading to the listed version. If the listed version is older than the version you are currently running, or if the table does not list any version in the column, then no upgrade candidate currently exists.
